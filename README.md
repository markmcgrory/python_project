### Initial CodeClan Brief: Shop Inventory

"Build an app which allows a shopkeeper to track their shop's inventory. This is not an app which the customer will see, it is an admin/management app for the shop workers." 

"Inspired by eBay, Amazon (back end only), Magento."

My approach was to build a "Bookshop Manager" web app aimed at staff working in a small bookstore. Functionality implemented: show book inventory, add to it or delete from it, show book details, update book details. Ditto with wholesalers, but the user can also filter books by wholesaler.
